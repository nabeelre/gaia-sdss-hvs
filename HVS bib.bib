	abstract = {In this paper, we report 591 high-velocity star candidates (HiVelSCs) selected from over 10 million spectra of Data Release 7 (DR7) of the Large Sky Area Multi-object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope and the second Gaia data release, with three-dimensional velocities in the Galactic rest frame larger than 445 km s-1. We show that at least 43 HiVelSCs are unbound to the Galaxy with escape probabilities larger than 50\%, and this number decreases to eight if the possible parallax zero-point error is corrected. Most of these HiVelSCs are metal-poor and slightly α-enhanced inner halo stars. Only 14\% of them have [Fe/H] {\textgreater} -1, which may be the metal-rich "in situ" stars in the halo formed in the initial collapse of the Milky Way or metal-rich stars formed in the disk or bulge but kinematically heated. The low ratio of 14\% implies that the bulk of the stellar halo was formed from the accretion and tidal disruption of satellite galaxies. In addition, HiVelSCs on retrograde orbits have slightly lower metallicities on average compared with those on prograde orbits; meanwhile, metal-poor HiVelSCs with [Fe/H] {\textless} -1 have an even faster mean retrograde velocity compared with metal-rich HiVelSCs. To investigate the origins of HiVelSCs, we perform orbit integrations and divide them into four types, i.e., hypervelocity stars, hyper-runaway stars, runaway stars and fast halo stars. A catalog for these 591 HiVelSCs, including radial velocities, atmospheric parameters, Gaia astrometric parameters, spatial positions, and velocities, etc., is available in the China-VO PaperData Repository at doi:10.12149/101038.},

	abstract = {The early third data release (EDR3) of the European Space Agency satellite Gaia provides coordinates, parallaxes, and proper motions for ∼1.47 billion sources in our Milky Way, based on 34 months of observations. The combination of Gaia DR2 radial velocities with the more precise and accurate astrometry provided by Gaia EDR3 makes the best data set available to search for the fastest nearby stars in our Galaxy. We compute the velocity distribution of ∼7 million stars with precise parallaxes, to investigate the high-velocity tail of the velocity distribution of stars in the Milky Way. We release a catalogue with distances, total velocities, and corresponding uncertainties for all the stars considered in our analysis1. By applying quality cuts on the Gaia astrometry and radial velocities, we identify a clean subset of 94 stars with a probability \$P\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{ub\} 50 \{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ to be unbound from our Galaxy. In total, 17 of these have \$P\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{ub\} 80\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ and are our best candidates. We propagate these stars in the Galactic potential to characterize their orbits. We find that 11 stars are consistent with being ejected from the Galactic disc, and are possible hyper-runaway star candidates. The other six stars are not consistent with coming from a known star-forming region. We investigate the effect of adopting a parallax zero-point correction, which strongly impacts our results: when applying this correction, we identify only 12 stars with \$P\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{ub\} 50\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ , 3 of these having \$P\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{ub\} 80\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ . Spectroscopic follow-ups with ground-based telescopes are needed to confirm the candidates identified in this work.},

	abstract = {We search for the fastest stars in the subset of stars with radial velocity measurements of the second data release (DR2) of the European Space Agency mission Gaia. Starting from the observed positions, parallaxes, proper motions, and radial velocities, we construct the distance and total velocity distribution of more than 7 million stars in our Milky Way, deriving the full 6D phase space information in Galactocentric coordinates. These information are shared in a catalogue, publicly available at http://home.strw.leidenuniv.nl/ marchetti/research.html. To search for unbound stars, we then focus on stars with a probability greater than 50 per cent of being unbound from the Milky Way. This cut results in a clean sample of 125 sources with reliable astrometric parameters and radial velocities. Of these, 20 stars have probabilities greater than 80 per cent of being unbound from the Galaxy. On this latter subsample, we perform orbit integration to characterize the stars' orbital parameter distributions. As expected given the relatively small sample size of bright stars, we find no hypervelocity star candidates, stars that are moving on orbits consistent with coming from the Galactic Centre. Instead, we find seven hyperrunaway star candidates, coming from the Galactic disc. Surprisingly, the remaining 13 unbound stars cannot be traced back to the Galaxy, including two of the fastest stars (around 700 km s-1). If conformed, these may constitute the tip of the iceberg of a large extragalactic population or the extreme velocity tail of stellar streams.},

	abstract = {We have discovered a star, SDSS J090745.0+024507, leaving the Galaxy with a heliocentric radial velocity of 853+/-12 km s-1, the largest velocity ever observed in the Milky Way halo. The star is either a hot blue horizontal-branch star or a B9 main-sequence star with a heliocentric distance of 39 or 71 kpc, respectively. Corrected for the solar reflex motion and to the local standard of rest, the Galactic rest-frame velocity is 709 km s-1. We suggest that this star is the first example of a hypervelocity star ejected from the Galactic center, as predicted by Hills and later discussed by Yu \& Tremaine. The star's radial velocity vector points 174° from the Galactic center. The star has [Fe/H]{\textasciitilde}0, consistent with a Galactic center origin, and a travel time of {\textless}{\textasciitilde}80 Myr from the Galactic center, consistent with its stellar lifetime. If the star is indeed traveling from the Galactic center, it should have a proper motion of {\textasciitilde}0.3 mas yr-1 observable with the Space Interferometry Mission or the Global Astrometric Interferometer for Astrophysics. Identifying additional hypervelocity stars throughout the halo will constrain the production rate history of hypervelocity stars at the Galactic center.},

	abstract = {Double detonations in double white dwarf (WD) binaries undergoing unstable mass transfer have emerged in recent years as one of the most promising Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) progenitor scenarios. One potential outcome of this “dynamically driven double-degenerate double-detonation” (D6) scenario is that the companion WD survives the explosion and is flung away with a velocity equal to its {\textgreater}1000 km s-1 pre-SN orbital velocity. We perform a search for these hypervelocity runaway WDs using Gaia's second data release. In this paper, we discuss seven candidates followed up with ground-based instruments. Three sources are likely to be some of the fastest known stars in the Milky Way, with total Galactocentric velocities between 1000 and 3000 km s-1, and are consistent with having previously been companion WDs in pre-SN Ia systems. However, although the radial velocity of one of the stars is {\textgreater}1000 km s-1, the radial velocities of the other two stars are puzzlingly consistent with 0. The combined five-parameter astrometric solutions from Gaia and radial velocities from follow-up spectra yield tentative 6D confirmation of the D6 scenario. The past position of one of these stars places it within a faint, old SN remnant, further strengthening the interpretation of these candidates as hypervelocity runaways from binary systems that underwent SNe Ia.},

	abstract = {We report the discovery of 30 stars with extreme space velocities (≳480 \{km\} \{\{\{s\}\}\}-1) in the Gaia-DR2 archive. These stars are a subset of 1743 stars with high-precision parallax, large tangential velocity (v tan {\textgreater} 300 \{km\} \{\{\{s\}\}\}-1), and measured line-of-sight velocity in DR2. By tracing the orbits of the stars back in time, we find at least one of them is consistent with having been ejected by the supermassive black hole at the Galactic Center. Another star has an orbit that passed near the Large Magellanic Cloud about 200 Myr ago. Unlike previously discovered blue hypervelocity stars, our sample is metal-poor (-1.5 {\textless} [Fe/H] {\textless} -1.0) and quite old ({\textgreater}1 \{Gyr\}). We discuss possible mechanisms for accelerating old stars to such extreme velocities. The high observed space density of this population, relative to potential acceleration mechanisms, implies that these stars are probably bound to the Milky Way (MW). If they are bound, the discovery of this population would require a local escape speed of around ∼600 \{km\} \{\{\{s\}\}\}-1 and consequently imply a virial mass of M 200 ∼ 1.4 × 1012 M ⊙ for the MW.

Triaxiality of dark matter halos is predicted by cold dark matter models of galaxy formation and may be used to probe the nature of dark matter. However, unless the distance to this star is determined to better than 10\%, these constraints suffer from one-dimensional degeneracies, which we quantify. We show how proper-motion measurements of several HVSs could simultaneously resolve the distance degeneracies of all such stars and produce a detailed picture of the triaxial halo. Additional HVSs may be found from radial velocity surveys or from parallax/proper-motion data derived from Gaia. High-precision proper-motion measurements of these stars using the Space Interferometry Mission (SIM PlanetQuest) would substantially tighten the constraints they yield on the Galactic potential.},
